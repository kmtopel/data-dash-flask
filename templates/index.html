                        The purpose of this website is to provide a centralized resource, that includes a near real-time violence data dashboard from multiple sources of data. This shared information can be used to further the understanding of the burden of community violence, the response to violence, and violence prevention efforts in and around Milwaukee, Wisconsin.                     </p>

                        About</h6>
                    <p class='card-text'> 
                        As we work together to address violence in our community, it is imperative to put data in the hands of community members and organizations carrying out community-engaged violence intervention and prevention work. This effort is unique in that it is bringing together multiple existing, disparate datasets to create more real-time data sharing across systems. These data are intended to inform community organizations, community members, stakeholders, and researchers about violence patterns, and provide a new tool to support the neighborhoods and communities working to reduce the impact of violence. This effort aligns with Goal 1A. of Milwaukeeâ€™s <a target="#" href="https://www.preventioninstitute.org/sites/default/files/publications/Milwaukee%20Blueprint%20for%20Peace.pdf">Blueprint for Peace</a>: enhance local capacity to access, analyze, and utilize violence-related data from a variety of sources to inform violence prevention efforts.
